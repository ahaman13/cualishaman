		<h1>Harris County Public Library</h1>
        <h2>Context</h2>
        	<p>The Harris County Public Library System serves the greater Harris County area in Texas. There are 26 branch locations. The HCPL system is hosted at <a href="https://hcpl.net/">hcpl.net</a>. From there, access to the catalog, events, services and online resources is available to whoever visits the site.</p>

	<h3>Users</h3>
		<p>The users of this system are primarily meant to be the residents of the county. Anyone can apply for a library card, but that is only required for checking out or placing a hold on materials from the library. Access to the branch locations and services does not require a card. Since this is a public library system, the range of users is immense. The system will be serving all ages and stages of life, from babies and their guardians to the elderly. Both their calendars and catalog have filters that accommodate this range of users:</p>

	
	<ul>
	<li>Kids</li>
	<li>Teens</li>
	<li>Adults</li>
	</ul>

        

	<h3>Content</h3>
		<p>Since this is a public library, most of the content is their catalog of materials. HCPL's catalog is found through the 'Browse' tab, which has five sections:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Catalog and Overdrive/Libby</li>
	<li>By Audience</li>
	<li>By Format</li>
	<li>Recommendations</li>
	<li>More</li>
	</ul>


	<p>There are both physical and digital forms of media available for loan. To check out a physical book, DVD, CD, or magazine, the item can be requested and picked up at a local branch. The system uses Libby to provide access to their digital titles.</p>
	
	<p>Within each catalog entry is information about the title, including title name, author, edition, copies in collection, holds placed, and version you are currently looking at. There are dropdown options available to see more information, including reviews from users, and detailed catalog information beyond title, authors and edition.</p>



	<h3>Unique Features</h3>
	<p>HCPL has many features and offerings that are stand-out and commendable for a for a library to provide. A personal favorite of mine is their section dedicated to Homeschool and Educator Resources. I was homeschooled until I attended college, and seeing events and resources offered to supplement and support homeschooling families is wonderful. Some events are even catered to homeschoolers entirely.</p>


	<h3>Pros and Cons of the System</h3>
	
	<p>Overall this system is one that is designed to be user friendly and easy to navigate. However, in my brief review of the system for this assignment, and recalling struggles I have encountered when using the system personally, it is not a perfect one. I find that some of the graphics are difficult to navigate around and can be very noisy on the eyes. There is also an inconstant use of color across the website on different pages which adds to the busy visuals. The site is also difficult to use on a mobile device. While there is a mobile version, it is not very user friendly.</p>
	<p>However, it is teeming with information and services. The navigation bar at the top is helpful in showing everything available to a visitor of the site. The libraries also offer so many services beyond just a catalog and media check-out. There are education programs available, ranging from citizenship to ESL to tax services to veteran resources. Additionally, there are a variety of electronic services available, though these vary by branch location. Copying and printing are the most common. There are sometimes 3D printing, SD card readers, and laptops among other equipment that is available for in-library use.</p>

	<h3>Suggested Improvements</h3>
	<p> I do think it could be worthwhile to reconfigure the dropdown options available at the top navigation bar. While there is a general organization to them I think that that organization could be refined further. I also think that the link and button to apply for a library card should be further up on the webpage as that is a key feature to access the catalog. And finally, the graphics and colors could be unified a bit.</p>
