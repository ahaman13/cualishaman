	<p>Assignment #2 - System Analysis and Usability Test</p>

	<h1>CUA's The Tower Analysis</h1>
	<h2>Context</h2>
	<p>
	This assignment focused on analyzing The Tower's <a href="https://cuatower.com/">website</a> through a Heuristic Analysis and a usability test.
	</p>

	<h3>Inputs and Outputs</h3>
		<p>What follows is a table of inputs and outputs that occur on The Tower’s website</p>
	

	<table style="border-style: solid; border-width: 2px;">
		<tr>
			<th>Input</th>
			<th>Output</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Clicking article picture/link on the homepage</td>
			<td>Brings the user to that article in the same tab</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Clicking section in the top bar</td>
			<td>Takes user to a page for all the articles of that section of the paper in same tab</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>clicking The Tower logo at the bottom of the page</td>
			<td>Opens file of the image in same tab</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Click the yellow arrow button that appears after scrolling past the top bar</td>

	<h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>

		<p>What follows is an analysis of The Tower's website following the Nielsen's 10 principles.</p>
	

		<ol>
			<li>Visibility of system status</li>
				<ul>
				<li>There is a loading screen upon initially entering the site or when an article takes a bit longer to load. However, there is no text or helpful information that appears to let the user know what is going on in the system.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Match between the system and the real world</li>
				<ul>
				<li>There is a clarity in the terms and icons used. Nothing is unique to The Tower, and it is easy for a user to understand and follow along.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>User control and freedom</li>
				<ul>
				<li>There is no clear ‘back’ button. However, every article has a series of links showing the progression through the website to the article, starting with ‘Home’ and progressing through the year, month, and then to the article title currently viewed by the user. Additionally, there is no filtering system for search results or any way to reorder the results.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Consistency and standards</li>
				<ul>
				<li>Again, there is no odd use of language here. All the language used by The Tower is meant in its typical context, and additionally all language pertaining to the Catholic University of America makes sense within the context of the University Community.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Error prevention</li>
				<ul>
				<li>There are not many confirmation messages on The Tower’s website. There are no notices when a link leads to a separate page that is not connected to The Tower. Additionally, there are no notices before clicking a link to a different article. The webpage simply opens in the link in the same tab rather than opening the second article in a new tab.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
				<ul>
				<li>The Tower website utilizes clear labels that allow the user to easily navigate. There is no confusion about where one might be trying to go, it is all clear and easy to follow. However, it might actually be said that there is an overabundance of labeling. The list of Tower archives is duplicated.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
				<ul>
				<li>There are no shortcuts or changes in process that can speed up the interactions.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
				<ul>
				<li>The design is a bit busy at times. While the majority of the articles contain images, those images do not need to be shown on the front page. They take up more space for the user’s eye. However, the color composition and font selections are clean and easy to read. There are not too many overwhelming colors, as the theme is based on navy, dark grey, and white with some highlights of dark yellow and red. However, there is no way to collapse the long list of Tower archives that is placed on the side and bottom of the website.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</li>
				<ul>
				<li>There are no clear error messages that appear on The Tower’s website. I did not encounter any defunct pages while exploring the website. If a search result provides no results, there is a message that suggests using different keywords in order to retrieve results.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Help and documentation</li>
				<ul>
				<li>There is no clear documentation about how to use the website. However, no additional explanations are needed in order to properly and clearly use the website.</li>
				</ul>
		</ol>


	<h3>The Best and the Worst</h3>
		<p>The strongest part of The Tower’s webpage is their design. It is clean and easy to follow, and allows the user to clearly see what is presented on the webpage. Their clean design is consistent throughout the site, and it allows their articles to be easily accessible. It follows Nielsen’s Heuristics very closely in this regard, though there is a glaring problem with their design. This problem is mentioned just below.</p>

		<p>The worst part of The Tower is also related to the strongest. The layout of the website has a massive flaw, and that is the list of archives going back to September 2015. There is a sidebar that lists all the archives by month. This exact list is duplicated at the bottom of the website. There is no way to collapse these lists, or remove them from view. This causes an extraneous amount of scrolling for any user to reach the bottom of the page or to reach archives that date back further than the past two years.</p>

<img src="./images/tower_archive_1.png" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;" />

<img src="./images/tower_archive_2.png" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;" />

		<p>The second best part of the website is the simplicity of the website. There are no guidelines presented for ways to navigate the website as it is very simple. While it could potentially behoove The Tower to include a guide of some kind, the webpage is so simple that it is unneeded. Adding one would simply add to the mass of information already on The Tower’s website.</p>

		<p>The second worst part of the website is the lack of maneuverability. There are no filters accessible to use for narrowing search results, nor is there a way to reorder search results. The lack of a filtering system is a true setback when trying to find certain topics. Additionally, besides the ‘back’ button on the user’s web browser, there is no easy way to move around the webpage. While the headers at the tops of articles are helpful, the lack of customization can become frustrating.</p>


	<h3>Comparison to the Usability Results</h3>
		<p>There were mostly similarities between the Heuristic Analysis and the mini-usability test; the test primarily highlighted more specifics about the negative or positive aspects of the website. It was easy for the volunteer to navigate around the site, as he pointed out himself. The UI was attractive enough for it to garner a specific comment about how attractive it was. The volunteer noted how the information was consistent all around, there were no difficulties in comprehending what The Tower was trying to do in its design and execution. I noted the same in my analysis, that The Tower is consistent with itself and other websites. The lack of elaboration on the archives and their older issues beyond 2015 is something that I overlooked in detail in my analysis, but it was noted during the test since the lack of those editions or ways to access them was crucial for the volunteer’s task. An easy way to resolve this issue would be to first move the archives to a separate page, then to include a link that takes the user to the older editions of The Tower. In summation, my observation and analysis through the Heuristics recognizes many issues that became apparent during the volunteer’s session.</p>
