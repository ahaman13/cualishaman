		<h1><i>The Extinction</i></h1>
		<p>
			It is the fear of catastrophic change, <b>the extinction of humanity and its replacement by something else</b>, especially by humanity's own doing. It was possibly once part of The End but has grown into its own fear now that the end of humanity may no longer be the end of life itself.

It's first appearance was recorded in <a href="https://snarp.github.io/magnus_archives_transcripts/episode/144.html">the statement of Gary Boylan</a>. Mr. Boylan's encounter with The Extinction seemed to be through a song track titled <i>Numbers</i> that appeared on his iPod. It contained a few of the following strands spoken in a strange monotone voice:
		<ul>
			<li>Five. Nine. Three. Seven. Five. Six.</li>
			<li>Three. Zero. Five. Eight. Three. Nine. Two. Eight. Four. Six.</li>
			<li>Four. Seven. Four. Nine.</li>
			<li>One. Six. Two. Eight. Three. Zero. One. Six. Five. Zero. Four. Nine.</li>
			<li>Five. Six. Four. Eight. Four. Six. Four. Seven. Four. Eight. Two. Seven.</li>
		</ul>
